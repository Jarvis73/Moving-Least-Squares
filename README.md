# Moving Least Squares (MLS)

**Update: 2020-09-25** No need for so-called inverse transformation. Just transform target pixels to the corresponding source pixels.

## Introduction
**Moving least squares** is a method of reconstructing continuous functions from a set of unorganized point samples via the calculation of a weighted least squares measure biased towards the region around the point at which the reconstructed value is requested.

In computer graphics, the moving least squares method is useful for reconstructing a surface from a set of points. Often it is used to create a 3D surface from a point cloud through either downsampling or upsampling.
